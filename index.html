    Note: This poll blocks multiple voting attempts based upon IP address. That
    means on a single home wifi, only one vote on the network will count every
    hour, and having this webpage open on multiple computers will do
    you no good. Have a cell phone? Turn off wifi and you'll be able to make more votes.
